"CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. – Two men were shot dead and six people were injured in four separate shootings in only five days, leading Clarksville police to ramp up patrols this weekend and ask some businesses to close early.As of Friday evening, no arrests had been made in any of the cases.The latest shooting came Thursday night. Shortly after 9 p.m. Clarksville police were called to the 100 block of Chapel Street, where they found 24-year-old Fran Daniel Caratini of Clarksville on the ground behind one of the apartments.Caratini, called ""Frankie"" by his friends, died at the scene. He did not live in the apartment complex and it was unclear why he was there.On Wednesday, six people were injured in two separate shootings just four hours apart. Clarksville Police Department spokeswoman Natalie Hall said police had no definitive evidence Friday that any of the shootings were related.Victim linked to slain manLast Sunday, another Clarksville man — the uncle of Caratini's young son — was also found shot to death.Andre Mitchell, 27, of Clarksville was found dead in the backseat of a vehicle behind a Waffle House on Fort Campbell Boulevard in Clarksville on Aug. 10, according to a CPD press release. At about the same time, Oak Grove Police responded to a call of shots fired at Club Gravity and found shell casings in the area. That case remains unsolved.Clarksville bail bondsman Jamie Kojac Thomas said Caratini came to see him just two hours before his death Thursday because he had failed to appear in court on a DUI charge on Tuesday. Thomas could have locked him up because a bench warrant had been issued, but Caratini told him that he had arranged through his attorney to appear in court Friday.Caratini had his young son with him and told Thomas that the boy's uncle had been murdered last week.""He said his baby's mama's brother was the one found dead (Sunday),"" Thomas said. ""That kind of floored me.""Caratini asked Thomas not to lock him up Thursday night and promised he would appear in court Friday. Thomas said Caratini was a repeat client, and he had posted bond for him over the years on charges ranging from aggravated assault to speeding. Most of the charges were alcohol related, he said. Caratini was scheduled for a violation of probation hearing Sept. 8.He said he had become friendly with Caratini over the years and was upset when he got the call about his death. Caratini had two children, he said.Clarksville Police have not said there is a gang connection.Extra patrolsPolice Chief Al Ansley said there will be extra patrols this weekend ""in specific areas of interest"" to prevent further violence.""We are on top of it,"" he said Friday afternoon. ""We have extra people on the street. We know what's going on ... We are being proactive to all the violence.""He said a number of businesses agreed to help police by closing early this weekend. He did not name the businesses, but said he appreciates their cooperation.All of the shootings remain under investigation.Detectives went door to door at the apartments on Chapel Street on Friday, talking to people who live in the apartment complex.'Too much drama'A number of small groups gathered on porches outside to talk to one another Friday, but while several said they knew Caritini, or ""Frankie"" as they called him, no one saw what happened.A man who asked not to be identified said his girlfriend heard a gunshot Thursday night and he went outside to find Caritini laying on the ground at the corner of an apartment building. His young step-daughter saw the man too, but by then a number of other people had come outside to see what was happening, he said.""I heard the commotion going on and when I came out, he was just laying there,"" the man said.He said he did not know who shot Caritini, a man he knew only in passing.Karen Judge said she arrived home after police arrived Thursday night and was worried only about the safety of her two granddaughters who are spending the summer with her.""I stay to myself because there's too much drama,"" she said. ""I don't bother nobody and nobody bothers me.""Six shot on WednesdayPolice were busy Wednesday with two separate shootings that injured six people.Two men were injured after gunfire was apparently exchanged between two vehicles on Caldwell Lane and Edmondson Ferry Road.

The Ford F-150 and a white car that was driving behind it both took off at a high rate of speed toward Trenton Road.Taylor Barger, 20, of Clarksville was shot in her leg and hip. She was found laying on the ground about 10 feet from the home. Donavon Smith, 27, was shot in his upper left leg. A 16-year-old was shot in one finger while looking out his bedroom window.

President Clyde Muse says one building will be renovated to house classrooms. The property adjoins the college's current nursing and allied health programs near Central Mississippi Medical Center.The college could use the property for a surgical simulation center to help train students. Plans also call for a lodge for families of burn victims being treated at the hospital.The 11 extension service employees will relocate to Eagle Ridge Conference Center in Raymond, possibly as early as Christmas.In Vicksburg,members of the Mayor's Health Council hope to work out a plan under which the Vicksburg farmers market can accept electronic benefits transactions as part of a plan to improve the health of Vicksburg residents.""If we don't get people healthier, they're always going to be sick and depending on the government's pockets,"" said council member Vanessa Prentiss, who teaches health classes at Kings Empowerment Center. ""This is our city, and we want our city to last and our people to last.""Council member Gail Kavanaugh, nutrition director for the Vicksburg Warren School District, told The Vicksburg Post (http://bit.ly/YZ48V8) the system could involve the farmers market manager accepting EBTs -- electronic food stamps -- and issuing tokens that can be traded to market vendors, or allowing farmers to accept EBT payments at their booths.The ability to accept EBT transactions would allow more access to fresh fruits and vegetables for low-income residents, Kavanaugh said. EBT is accepted at several farmers' markets around the state, she said.""It's very important for the community to know this is in the best interest of farmers and the community,"" she said.So far, the move has been a tough sell to farmers, she said.""Many of them are skeptical and don't want the government involved in their business,"" she said.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of ourUser Agreement,Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement,andYour California Privacy Rights(each updated 1/1/21).Cookie Settings©2021Advance Local Media LLC.

"A second teen was arrested Tuesday in the shooting of 15 people at a Miami nightclub.The 16-year-old juvenile was charged with one count of accessory after the fact (attempted first degree murder) and 14 counts of accessory after the fact (aggravated battery) for his alleged role in the Sept. 28 shooting at The Spot.The teen told police he was at the club during the shooting but denied knowing the other person charged, 17-year-old Will Campbell, who was arrested Monday, according to the arrest affidavit.But Campbell told detectives Monday that he knew the 16-year-old and that they were both in the club on the night of shooting, the affadavit says. Detectives also said that Campbell’s and the 16-year-old’s Facebook accounts showed pictures of the two together.Police believe Campbell was the triggerman in the mass shooting at The Spot. Campbell is being charged with attempted first-degree murder and 14 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm.Police Chief Manuel Orosa said detectives had been looking for Campbell throughout the weekend before taking him into custody Monday afternoon. Police said Campbell has been talking with detectives with his mother present.Chief Orosa said the shooting stemmed from a fight at Norland Senior High School.“One of his friends got involved in a fight, and when [he] and his friends arrived at The Spot, they found the other person involved in the fight there,"" Orosa said. ""He was told that [another patron] was the other juvenile involved in the fight. So he took out a gun and shot that juvenile, who’s in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital. He also shot at the crowd as he was running away, hitting 14 other people.""Police said since Campbell is still under 18, he will go through the juvenile justice system for now.Orosa said Campbell didn’t have much of an arrest history. The chief said Campbell had arrests for obstructing a police officer and possession of marijuana.Campbell was arrested just days after The Spot's manager Tiffany Johnson was arrested and given a notice to appear in court for allegedly selling liquor without a license.Johnson, 31, was arrested after agents found bottles of liquor behind the bar during an inspection of the facility. The bar only had a license to sell beer and wine."

"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) – Clairton and Allegheny County Police continue to investigate after a half-dozen people were shot overnight inside what investigators describe as a “speakeasy.”It was about 3:30 a.m. when Clairton Police got a number of 911 calls about gunfire that began inside the establishment on the 600-block of Miller Avenue.On Friday afternoon, workers from the City of Clairton made sure no one would go back into the building, which is now condemned.A group of young men, not believed to be local to Clairton, confronted a group already inside and then the gunfire rang out.“From what we’re piecing together, it sounds like there was a group of young men who arrived, who are not local to Clairton. We’re not sure where they’re from, and shortly after they arrived, there was some type of fight and then the shooting following thereafter,” said Allegheny County Police Lt. Andrew Schurman.In all, six people were shot, and victims as well as patrons scattered. Two were in serious condition at mid-day. Three people were transported to hospitals from the scene. Three other victims showed up later at area hospitals by their own means.All of the victims are men in their early 20s.The gunfire started in the building, but may have spilled out into the street.“There is a car that showed up at one of the hospitals with bullet holes in it, so it may have,” said Lt. Schurman.The sign on the door said members only 21 or older, but investigators called what went on inside as a speakeasy where liquor was sold without a license.“In speaking with the Clairton police, the understanding that I have is that this establishment is not a licensed business, and in some capacity, they are selling alcohol illegally,” said Lt. Schurman. “They used the term ‘speakeasy’ to describe it.

When Karissa told that to Colter, he grabbed the .223 and began shooting in a very rapid fashion,"" Jackley said.Arbach used a .223 rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun to fire on Renville Jr., whose body was found next to the driver's side door of a Kia vehicle. The bodies of Labelle and Adams were found on the other side of the vehicle. Both passenger side doors of the Kia were open.""Karissa was shot several times in the back,"" Jackley said.Arbach's body was found outside the home, as well.

"MISHAWAKA — One man is charged with illegally carrying a handgun in connection with a shooting that injured four people after a party swelled to hundreds of people at an event center in southeastern St. Joseph County.Rodney Taylor, 34, was arrested on a single count of being a serious violent felon in possession of a handgun after police responded to gunfire at the Oaks at Southpaw Farm, 16323 Roosevelt Road, early Sunday morning.County police were still working to identify possible suspects in the shooting, Lt. Matt Blank, a spokesman, said Wednesday. He said Taylor was part of the investigation, but it was unclear if he was suspected of taking part in the gunfire.Three of the victims were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries Sunday morning, and a fourth ran away from the scene of the shooting. None of the victims had provided police with information about possible shooters.""We're getting very little cooperation,"" Blank said. ""This thing's kind of moving real slow at this point.""Terrance Shorter, 22; Armond Davis, 21; and Brandon Burton, 21, were among those injured.Police who responded to the shooting found a chaotic scene, as party-goers tried to run away before officers could secure the area. Police estimated about 500 people attended the event.Blank said management at the Oaks likely had no idea the party, which was originally billed as a much smaller event, would end in violence.""I think they're more the victim here than anything,"" he said. ""I'm quite sure they had no idea"" the event would spiral out of control.The Oaks is operated by a Christian organization called Point of Light Ministries, according to its website. The 77-acre property once belonged to former Major League Baseball pitcher Jamie Moyer, who converted the large barn into an 11,000-square-foot home. A reporter's call to the facility went unanswered Wednesday.According to court documents, the shooting Sunday broke out on the back deck of the house. Security guards may have also been involved in an altercation around the time the shooting broke out, according to the documents.Police found Taylor in an upstairs bedroom. A black-and-silver handgun was allegedly found in his pocket. He previously served time in federal prison for his role in a bank robbery, the court documents said.574-235-6480csheckler@sbtinfo.com@jcshecklerSuccess!An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup.Error!There was an error processing your request.The news you need to start your day, sent weekday mornings.The day's top 5 news headlines, sent weekday evenings."

"ROCKFORD — Six years after a Rockford woman tragically lost her daughter and two grandsons in a quadruple homicide, she says she's chosen to forgive the killer.“By the grace of God, he has given me peace,” said Rolanda Collins, who spent the anniversary of their death last weekend surrounded by family. There was no special memorial or tribute, just a place of love, she said.Collins' daughter, Martia Flint, was at home with her two sons, Tyrone Smith III, 6, and Tobias K. Smith, 4, and her boyfriend, Demontae Rhodes, on Dec. 20, 2014, when all four were shot to death.Calvin L. Carter, 28, who has ties to Rockford and the St. Louis area, was convicted of the killings and sentenced to four life terms plus 280 years in prison.More:‘They deserve to be celebrated’: Hundreds mourn loss of slain Rockford familyMore:Calvin Carter sentenced to four life terms plus 280 years for killing 4Since the trialended in 2017, Collins has relocated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she has joined World Outreach and Bible Training Center. Her new church home has provided support and comfort over the years, and that's where she found the strength to forgive Carter.“There’s a group at the church called the Healing Clinic. I ended up going there one day because I needed healing. It was imparted to me that I needed to forgive my daughter’s murderer in order to become free.“I decreed and declared, ‘I forgive you Calvin Carter, for what you took from me, for what you did to my daughter and my grandchildren.’ I said it and I said it from my heart. My life has not been the same since. I have found so much peace and I’ve developed a deeper level with Christ.”She’s gotten involved with church organizations that work in the community.“Being a victim of domestic violence myself and suffering the loss of my family members and loved ones, I’ve made it a priority [to help] other families who are deemed high risk due to domestic violence. It’s as prevalent here as in Rockford.”Within the last year, Collins has also started journaling.A Mother’s Prayerwas formed in 2015 with a mission of neutralizing violence, restoring hope in the community and transforming youths’ minds. It was founded based on Collins' tragedy and loss, but since her move, it’s been dormant.That’s about to change.She's relaunching A Mother's Prayer in Wisconsin to help women in abusive relationships. Collins said she was once in one and then after learning about her daughter’s relationship, she felt called to be a resource for other victims.“We’re looking for a building to house people or assist people who are in need of transitional housing or a safe house,” she said.The organization will also help them obtain an order of protection.She wants other women to know their value and self-worth.“I want to encourage them and build them up,” she said.If a woman finds herself in a domestic violence situation, Collins said the first step is for them to ask themselves ‘Who am I?’ so they can acknowledge their self-worth. From there, they must seek help from loved ones.“One thing my daughter didn’t do is she didn’t tell me, she told everybody else but me,” she said. “What hurts me more than anything is my daughter didn’t give me the opportunity to help her.”Collins encourages women to get to a safe place.“Once there, you can take action,” she said. “There is nothing anyone can (do to) justify why they put their hands on you or demean your character.”A Mother’s Prayer is Collins' way of keeping her daughter’s legacy alive.“Because he got sentenced to life, that equals justice for some, but it doesn’t for me,” she said. “I’m sure the Rhodes family would agree. That doesn’t equal justice for us. That doesn’t bring our children back. That doesn’t make us feel better.“I still get angry at times, but when I look at A Mother’s Prayer and what’s about to be birthed and transpire I know there’s a platform God is escalating me to so I can help others who are victims of a violent crime such as this.”A Mother’s Prayer is seeking sponsors and is collecting donations such as winter clothes for women, coats, boots and more. People can call her at 414-544-3791 or email atCollinsrolanda@icloud.comto schedule a drop-off.

"ByHelen PowPublished:18:48 EDT, 28 December 2012|Updated:22:06 EDT, 28 December 201211ViewcommentsA 24-year-old woman has been arrested for buying the assault rifle used to murder two innocent firefighters on Christmas Eve, on behalf of the killer.Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York, was a former neighbor of William Spengler, 62, who shot dead firefighters Michael Chiapperini and Tomasz Kaczowka in a shocking ambush as they responded to a house fire he started early Monday morning.Three other people were wounded before Spengler killed himself.According to police, Nguyen purchased the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun on behalf of Spengler,a convicted felon who was barred from possessing weapons,on June 6, 2010.Accessory: Nguyen is pictured after her arrest on charges connected to the guns used in the Christmas Eve ambush slaying of two volunteer firefightersSpengler is believed to have picked out the weapons himself at a firearm store in Henrietta, New York.The young woman faces a federal charge of knowingly making a false statement, U.S. Attorney William Hochul said, and is also charged with a state count of filing a falsified business record.The gunman also had a .38-caliber revolver in his possession on the day of the shootings, but Nguyen is not connected to that gun. Police used the serial numbers on the weapons to trace them to Nguyen.Killer: William Spengler had previously served 17 years in prison for killing his elderly grandmother'She told the seller of these guns, Gander Mountain in Henrietta, N.Y., that she was to be the true owner and buyer of the guns instead of William Spengler,' Hochul said.'It is absolutely against federal law to provide any materially false information related to the acquisition of firearms.'During an interview late on Christmas Eve, Nguyen told police she had bought the guns for personal protection and that they were stolen from her vehicle, though she never reported the guns stolen.The day after the shootings, however, Nguyen texted an off-duty Monroe County Sheriff's deputy with references to the killings and later admitted to him that she bought the guns for Spengler.Police said that information was consistent with a suicide note found near Spengler's body after he killed himself.The .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle, which had a combat-style flash suppressor, is similar to the one Adam Lanza used to shoot dead 20 children and six female staff at Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, earlier this month.Nguyen and her mother, Dawn Welsher, lived next door to Spengler in 2008 - when Nguyen was just 20 years old.On Wednesday and again on Friday, shortly before her arrest, she answered her cellphone and told The Associated Press that she didn't want to talk about Spengler.Her brother, Steven Nguyen, told the Democrat and Chronicle newspaper of Rochester that Spengler stole the guns from Dawn Nguyen.Bushmaster: Nguyen allegedly bought the Bushmaster rifle, pictured, for William Spengler and he used it to shoot two firefightersHome: Dawn Nguyen was arrested at her home, pictured, at 249 Alpine Road in Rochester, New YorkSpengler set a car on fire and touched off an inferno in his Webster home on a strip of land along the Lake Ontario shore, took up a sniper's position and opened fire on the first firefighters to arrive at about 5:30am on Christmas Eve, authorities said. He wounded two other firefighters and an off-duty police officer who was on his way to work.A Webster police officer who had accompanied the firefighters shot back at Spengler with a rifle in a brief exchange of gunfire before the gunman killed himself.Spengler spent 17 years in prison for killing his grandmother in 1980. His neighbors said he confessed his criminal past within 15 minutes of them meeting, and even pointed to the staircase where he committed the crime.'He said, ""I was on drugs and I wanted money for drugs and my grandmother wouldn't give it to me,""' Amy Warner, who bought the cottage next to Spengler's home with her boyfriend this summer, toldNew York Magazine.She said they tore out the staircase 'because it was creepy,' but didn't think twice about buying the house because Spengler had served his time.Her home was one of seven destroyed by the fire Spengler started.Trap: This billowing inferno in Webster, New York, was lit by William Spengler, before he opened fire on the firefighters who responded to the blazeBrave: Webster police Lieutenant Mike Chiapperini (left) and Tomasz Kaczowka, (right) a 911 dispatcher, both volunteered for the West Webster Fire Department. They were gunned down on Monday morningBurning: A bystander watches while seven homes in a street in Webster, New York, burnedInvestigators still haven't released the identity of remains found in William Spengler's burned house.They have said they believe the remains are those of his 67-year-old sister, Cheryl Spengler, who also lived in the house near Rochester and has been unaccounted for since the killings.The Spengler siblings had lived in the home with their mother, Arline Spengler, who died in October. Police found a rambling, typed letter laying out Spengler's intention to destroy his neighborhood and 'do what I like doing best, killing people.'He had been released from parole in 2006 on the manslaughter conviction, and authorities said they had had no encounters with him since.Nguyen faces a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, a fine of $250,000 or both.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"
